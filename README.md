# odin-recipes
This is my progress on the first of The Odin Project's project assignments.
In this assignment, I am reqired to create a basic HTML website that is able to link to different recipes.

Reflection:
This was a pretty fun project! Managed to get it done in just a few hours and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Image sizing was a bit of trouble but outside of that, everything felt pretty good. Overall, I think this project did a good job at stretching my skills at html coding, and I'm excited to learn about CSS and Javascript!
